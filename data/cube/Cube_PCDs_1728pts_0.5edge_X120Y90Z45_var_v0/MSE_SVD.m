% The following matrix was calculated using the Jacobi SVD algorithm, 
% as implemented in EIGEN (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/classEigen_1_1JacobiSVD.html), 
% a C++ template library for linear algebra, which is used by the
% Point Cloud Library (http://pointclouds.org/).

% GOOD CORRESPONDENCES -> As pointed out in the paper (Section V.B), we 
% use only the good correspondences, i.e. outlier-free correspondences, 
% stored in the file 'good_correspondences.txt', to plot the cost function 
% (CF) curve. This is done in order to obtain a CF learning curve free of outliers,
% what would naturally happen if the point matching in [1] was perfect. 
% This way, we can see how the rotors provided by the GA-LMS align the 
% true (good) correspondences.
